# Decision-Tree-From-Scratch-With-Python

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using Python, without relying on external machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. A decision tree is a popular supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, I build a decision tree for classification purposes.
